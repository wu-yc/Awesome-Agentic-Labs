# Awesome-Agentic-Labs

This repository manually collects works towards the era of **agentic labs**: the AI infrastructure of autonomous science.  
It is intended to be a **living bibliography + taxonomy** (papers, systems, benchmarks, and platforms) and will be continuously updated.

Authors: Yingcheng Charles Wu (Stanford), Le Cong* (Stanford), Mengdi Wang* (Princeton)  
Contact: wuyc@stanford.edu  

📖 News  
- **[2026/02/02]** Initial version released.
- **[2026/02/18]** Added (when available) **canonical paper links**, **exact posting/submission dates**, **GitHub links** (or GitHub search links), and a lightweight **taxonomy** (**Type** + **Autonomy**).

🌟 Overview  
Agentic labs represent a transformative era in AI-driven science, where autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs), multimodal capabilities, and integrated platforms function as full research partners. These agents generate hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze data, and iteratively refine processes across domains like life sciences, chemistry, materials science, physics, and astronomy.

## Conventions

### Taxonomy
- **Type**
  - **Survey**: overview / meta-analysis / perspectives
  - **System/Agent**: end-to-end or modular agentic research systems
  - **Benchmark/Eval**: benchmarks, environments, measurement frameworks
  - **Platform**: publishing / collaboration / infrastructure platforms
- **Autonomy**
  - Extracted only when authors explicitly state it (e.g., “Level 2”). Otherwise `-`.

### Links
- **Paper** links are **canonical** (arXiv/bioRxiv/DOI/publisher) when verified.  
  When not verified yet, the link points to an **arXiv search** for fast lookup.
- **Code** links point to an **official GitHub repo** when known.  
  Otherwise the link is a **GitHub repository search** (so every row has something actionable).
