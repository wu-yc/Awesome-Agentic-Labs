🌟 Overview  
Agentic labs represent a transformative era in AI-driven science, where autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs), multimodal capabilities, and integrated platforms function as full research partners. These agents generate hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze data, and iteratively refine processes across domains like life sciences, chemistry, materials science, physics, and astronomy. Research indicates this evolution from AI-assisted tools to agentic autonomy could accelerate discoveries by factors of 10-100, though challenges in reproducibility, ethical governance, and human oversight persist. Evidence suggests agentic infrastructures may democratize science, but equitable access and balanced human-AI collaboration are essential. For foundational insights, see surveys on autonomous discovery and agentic frameworks.
